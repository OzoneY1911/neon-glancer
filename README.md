# Neon Glancer

Top-down 3D shooter. Camera can be rotated with Q/E.

Colourful neon-style small game where player is defending himself against waves of enemies. Player can buy upgrades and consumables (first aid kit, armor) in shops. Game includes sounds and music, I used Audacity tool to make some adjustments. Only Unity Engine's default 3D assets were used.

Player needs to survive 10 waves to win.

WebGL builds of the game are available on:
